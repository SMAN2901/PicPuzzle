PicPuzzle is a puzzle type desktop game developed using core Java.

In this game you can choose a image from your local drive, break it into tiles and shuffle them. 
Then you have to assemble them again to form the original image. 
There are two different game modes - Relax mode and Rush mode.

In relax mode your score depends on the number of moves you use to solve the puzzle. 
In rush mode your score depends on the amount of time you spend to solve the puzzle.

Both mode has three different difficulty levels that differ from one another by the number of tiles.
